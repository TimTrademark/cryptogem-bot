</p>

> Disclaimer: It is not recommended to host the control panel on a public facing machine, as it is not production-ready.
> You can disable the web control panel by inserting `ENABLE_CONTROL_PANEL=FALSE` in the `.env` file.

Alternatively, the config.json file can be edited manually according to your needs:

```json
{
  "exchanges": {
    "mexc": {
      "api_key": "MY_API_KEY",
      "api_secret": "MY_API_SECRET",
      "funds": 6,
      "active": true
    }
  },
  "scheduling_timeout_seconds": 5
}
```

## Running the bot

It is recommended to run the bot using Docker:

```commandline
docker build -t mycryptogem .
docker run -d -p 0.0.0.0:5000:5000 mycryptogem
```

You can also provide a config.json to the Docker container:

```commandline
docker run -v C:/config_custom.json:/app/config.json mycryptogem
```

## Development

You are free to open pull requests or create issues, I will try to get to them as soon as possible. The bot is in active
development, so expect more features and changes soon!

Planned features are:

* Monthly/weekly/daily Budget limits ðŸ“…
* More exchange integrations ðŸ“ˆ
* Integrating trade history in control panel ðŸ“œ
